- you can download all of [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) to consult while offline
    - official [page](https://archive.org/details/stackexchange) from [internet archive](https://archive.org/) that includes all stackexchange sites and not just stackoverflow
    - download [page](https://archive.org/download/stackexchange) with list of files which includes one for stackoverflow
    - files are primarily in [7Z format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7z)
    - the [file](https://archive.org/download/stackexchange/stackoverflow.com-Posts.7z) for stackoverflow posts stands at around 16GB right now
    - what are some repos to help process the data dump after download
        - you can view and search with this [repo](https://github.com/Caspia/seekoff)
        - you can import and convert to sql via these [gists](https://gist.github.com/gousiosg/7600626)
        - you can create a graphql endpoint via this [repo](https://github.com/snimmagadda1/stack-exchange-graphql-server)
        - you can always explore repos from [@internetarchive](https://github.com/internetarchive) 
        - it would be nice to use something like the [how2 repo](https://github.com/santinic/how2)
            - it allows you to use natural language to ask technical questions right from the terminal
            - unfortunately currently you must be online
                - as how2 needs access to the stackoverflow internet api
            - if how2 could instead be connected to the data dump
                - and requests rerouted to data dump instead of internet
                - that would truly be awesome
